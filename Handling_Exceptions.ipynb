    "When you're programming, a lot can happen that you don't expect. You'll encounter a few different sets of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Things that are your fault (e.g. you had a typo)\n",
    "* Things that aren't your fault, but that are under your control (you expected a CSV to be in Dropbox that someone else on your team deleted)\n",
    "* Things that aren't your fault, but *not* under your control (you're using the Google Maps API to pull data, but Google returned an error)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python, these errors are called \"exceptions\"** (the behavior is an _exception_ to normal behavior). You can write your code _without_ handling exceptions, but your programs will fail miserably. We'll see examples of such failures below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your program may not be able to run without that CSV, or without hitting Google's API, so failing miserably might be OK in certain circumstances. But often, **just having your program fail isn't what you want**. If Google's API goes down, you may want to try hitting it again in 30 seconds. If that CSV you expect to be there isn't, you may want your script to send you an email letting you know.\n",
