A collection of Jupyter notebooks.

## Audience

You're learning Python and want easy-to-follow examples for performing common tasks.

Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive environment to execute Python code. Working in Jupyter notebooks is an ideal way to learn Python, since you can modify the code in each cell and immediately run it to see how that changes your result.

## Usage

First, create a Python virtual environment. Then, run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

to install the third party modules necessary to run the code in these notebooks.

Once finished, run

    jupyter notebook

to open these notebooks in a web browser, where you can work with the code.
